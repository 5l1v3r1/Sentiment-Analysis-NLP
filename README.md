## Documentation

## How to

```
git clone https://github.com/philipperemy/Sentiment-Analysis-NLP.git
cd Sentiment-Analysis-NLP
chmod +x init.sh
./init.sh
```

The script will download the [IMDB Sentiment Database](http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/) from Stanford University and unzip it.

Also, we consider the list of positive and negative words from Illinois University, available [here](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/FBS/sentiment-analysis.html#lexicon). This list has around 6800 words that we refer as keywords.
